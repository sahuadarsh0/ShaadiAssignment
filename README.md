# ShaadiAssignment

### Project Description:
Create an Android app that simulates a Matrimonial App by displaying match cards similar to
Shaadi.com's card format. The app should use the provided API to fetch user data and
display it in a recycler view. Users can accept or decline matches, and the app should store
and display their decisions persistently, even in offline mode.
